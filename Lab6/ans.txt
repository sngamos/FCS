1. we can use pre-shared keys, public key infrastructure, or DHKE to exchange keys. pre-shared keys would require a secured channel, but PKI and DHKE does not require secure channel, PKI and DHKE using asymmertric algorithms hence there is not a need for secure channel to exchange keys.
2. the advantages of DHKE are that we can establish a shared secret for 2 parties over a insecure channel. the disadvantages are that it is vulnerable to Man in the Middle attack if the attacker can intercept the key exchange process, and allows them to effectively decrypt and reencrypt messages between them.
